Simple but pleasing Anki styling that makes me more likely to actually do my reps.

## How to Use
Simply copy and paste the relevant HTML and CSS code into the Front Template, Back Template, and Styling pages. 

The only things to keep in mind are:
1. Using bold in the answer field will displace the bolded text slightly to the left. This is so that you can quickly use bold as a list header. It will not affect bolded text in the prompt field.
2. Regular text in the answer field is automatically italicised, but bolded text is not.

Note: copy and pasting text from Wikipedia and so on can inadvertently insert &nbsp characters, which messes with how mobile displays Anki cards. If this is happening, you can use Anki's "find and replace" to replace the characters with a regular space character.
